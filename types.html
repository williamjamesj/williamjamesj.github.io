        <h1>Types of Hackers</h1>
        <p>Although there are many different times of <i>hackers</i>, here are three of the most common types.</p>
        <h2>White Hat</h2>
        <p>White Hat hackers are commonly referred to as "Ethical Hackers" as they work alongside businesses and governments to find vulnerabilities and help these organisations to patch these vulnerabilities to avoid them being exploited by malicious actors such as Black Hat and Grey Hat hackers. White hat hackers are often employed by these organisations in order to help defend their computer systems, and large companies made up of these ethical hackers exist to help businesses patch holes in their cyberdefense. </p>
        <h2>Black Hat</h2>
        <p>Black hat hackers are the stereotypical malicious hackers who would attack computer systems, often for money; either from ransoming data or selling exploits to other malicious actors. </p>
        <h2>Grey Hat</h2>
        <p>Grey Hat hackers are a blend of the other two types, often acting out of curiosity about how computer systems work, not with the malicious intent of Black Hat hackers and without the benevolent interests of White Hat hackers. Grey Hat hackers often are breaking laws when they are hacking as they don't usually have permission from the system owners to do so, and they can still cause damage and interfere with an organisation.</p>
