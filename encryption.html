    <h1>Types of Encryption</h1>
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid textblock">
    <h2>Caesar Cipher</h2>
    <p>The first method (and most basic) method of encryption is the Caesar Cipher, a method that simply shifts all of the characters through the alphabet by a certain number (the key). For example, the plaintext "hello" shifted by a key of 1 would become "ifmmp", which becomes unreadable unless decrypted. These forms below ignores any non-alphanumeric characters.</p>
    <form>
        Plaintext: <input type="text" id="cs-plaintext">
        Key (Numbers to Shift by): <input type="number" id="cs-key">
        <input type="button" onclick="clickCaesarCipher();" value="Encrypt">
        <p id="cs-output">Please enter values into the form above.</p>
    </form>
    <p>Although the Caesar Cipher is very simple and easy to understand, it is not a viable encryption method when you want something to remain private. Because there are only 26 different potential plaintext strings, tools such as the one below, are available that can guess all potential combinations, and the user can easily select the combination that makes sense.</p>
    <form>
        Cipher-text: <input type="text" id="cs-ciphertext">
        Key (Enter 0 if unknown): <input type="number" id="cs-decrypt-key">
        <input type="button" onclick="decryptCaesarCipher();" value="Decrypt">
    </form>
    <br>
    <div id="cs-combinations"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="container-fluid textblock">
        <h2>Vigenère Cipher & Gronsfeld Cipher</h2>
        <p>The Vigenère Cipher is a more complicated method of encryption that typically uses a multiple character key, that can be used to encrypt data to an extent that is harder to brute force than a simple Caesar Cipher. <br> An example of such would be encrypting the message "hello" with the key of "dog". </p>
        <div class="instruction-block">
        <img src="resources/vgtable.jpg" class="image-right" width="300" length="190">
        <p>Step 1: Repeat the key, so that it is long enough for the entire plaintext. For example "dog" becomes "dogdo". <br> Step 2: For each of the characters, use a chart like the one to the right to change each of the characters, according to its companion in the repeated key. For example: The H becomes K, the E becomes S, the L becomes R, the second L becomes O and the final O becomes C. <br> Step 3: Put all of the characters together to make the encrypted text: In this example "hello" becomes "ksroc" after being encrypted with the key "dog".</p>
        </div>
        <p>This makes the Vigenère cipher much more difficult to crack, as there are significantly more potential combinations than a basic Caesar Cipher.</p>
