    <div class="container-fluid textblock">
        <h3>Social Engineering & Phishing</h3>
        <p>Social Engineering is one of the most common types of hacking, and potentially the easiest. The reason it is so easy and common is because it doesn't require a breach in computer infrastructure, instead relying on human weaknesses, by attempting to convince people to give up their credentials, or otherwise give access to computer systems that shouldn't be accessed by malicious actors. This form of hacking is typically only used by Black Hat hackers, as White Hat and Grey Hat focus on infiltrating systems through technological means. Educating employees on the dangers of social engineering is the best way to help prevent against this method.</p>

        <h3>Man in the Middle (MITM)</h3>
        <p>A Man in the Middle attack is when a third party intercepts information sent by a device to another, giving the thrid party access to the information. This information could be unencrypted passwords or an important message. To prevent against this attack, encryption is used, meaning that even if the third party gets access to the information, it will be useless as it is encrypted to be unreadable. </p>

    <div class= "container-fluid textblock">
        <h3>Ransomware/Malware</h3>
        <p>Malware is an overarching term for any malicious software that is installed on a computer. This malware could be installed by someone with access to the computer systems, such as an employee or a malicious third party. This software can log information entered into the system (commonly called a keylogger), infect other programs (a worm). A special type of malware called ransomware is particularly dangerous, as it encrypts/deletes informationstopping the rightful owners from accessing it, then charging the owners a ransom for the decryption/restoration of the files. </p>
