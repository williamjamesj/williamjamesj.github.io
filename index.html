            <p>The common conception of a <i>hacker</i> is someone who acts maliciously to infiltrate computer systems (often owned by legitimate organisations), for personal gain or other reasons. This isn’t necessarily true, as there are many kinds of hackers, some of whom act ethically to identify security vulnerabilities to stop malicious hackers from infiltrating the systems of legitimate systems. Additionally, these legitimate hackers are necessary to help control the massive damages caused by attacks on computer systems. </p>

            <h3 id="why">Why is hacking a problem?</h3>
            <p>In 2017, British insurer Lloyds estimated that a significant cyberattack against a cloud service provider could cause “estimated losses of $53 billion” in American dollars <span class="rollovertrigger">(Lloyd's, 2017)<span class="rolloverbox">Lloyd's. (2017, July 17). Extreme cyber-attack could cost as much as Superstorm Sandy. Retrieved from Lloyd's: https://www.lloyds.com/news-and-risk-insight/press-releases/2017/07/cyber-attack-report</span></span>. This is an absurd amount of damages that could be caused by a single vulnerability in a computer system, with no real solution to prevent against large scale cyberattacks. Another problem associated with hacking is social engineering, a strategy in which hackers attempt to gain access to a computer system, not by weaknesses in a computer, but a personnel weakness. This means that as long as there are humans, who will use guessable passwords, and fall for phishing attempts, there is no foreseeable permanent solution to hacking. Even with ethical hackers attempting to identify these vulnerabilities, these massive damages will still occur, making hacking one of the biggest problems facing organizations around the world.</p>

            <h3 id="what">What is hacking?</h3>
            <p>
                Hacking is the umbrella term for all types of computer manipulation regarding infiltrating computer systems, whether ethical, or non-ethical; legal, or illegal. For example, someone who infiltrates large corporation networks to steal money would be classified as a hacker just like someone who works for the bank to identify these vulnerabilities would also be classified as a hacker.

            <h3 id="how">How does hacking occur?</h3>
            <p>
                There are many ways that hacking can occur, being vulnerabilities in a computer system, and human weaknesses. Firstly, computer systems can have weaknesses, which can be exploited by malicious actors to gain access to systems they should not have access to. This does not have to be a weakness in that certain organization’s systems, as weaknesses in third-party tools can also introduce vulnerabilities into the system. The other common weakness is social engineering, which a small-scale survey at the DEFCON 2016 hacking conference found that “84 percent of respondents use social engineering as part of their attack strategy.” <span class="rollovertrigger">(Goldman, 2017)<span class="rolloverbox" style="width: 300%;margin-left: -150%;">Goldman, J. (2017, Febuary 28). Fully 84 Percent of Hackers Leverage Social Engineering in Cyber Attacks. Retrieved from eSecurity Planet: https://www.esecurityplanet.com/hackers/fully-84-percent-of-hackers-leverage-social-engineering-in-attacks.html<br>#:~:text=Fully%2084%20Percent<br>%20of%20Hackers%20<br>Leverage%20Social%20Engineering%20<br>in%20Cyber%20Attacks,-By%20Jeff%20Goldman</span></span>. This means that to secure IT infrastructure, there needs to be a focus on the computers themselves, but a large focus on educating the personnel that use the systems.

            <h3 id="ethical">Is there such thing as an "ethical" hacker?</h3>
            <p>
                Ethical hacking is when cybersecurity experts attempt to secure legitimate computer systems, often by performing a process known as penetration testing. Penetration testing is when an ethical hacker is contracted by an organization to attempt to find and exploit vulnerabilities in a computer network that could also be exploited by malicious actors. <span class="rollovertrigger">(Cloudflare, n.d.)<span class="rolloverbox">Cloudflare. (n.d.). What Is Penetration Testing? Retrieved from Cloudflare: https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-penetration-testing/</span></span>. A prominent example of successful penetration testing was the US Department of Defense’s “Hack the Pentagon” <span class="rollovertrigger">(US Department of Defense, 2018)<span class="rolloverbox" style="width: 200%;margin-left: -100%;">US Department of Defense. (2018, October 24). Department of Defense Expands ‘Hack the Pentagon’ <br>Crowdsourced Digital Defense Program. Retrieved from US Department of Defense: <br>https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/1671231/<br>department-of-defense-expands-hack-the-pentagon-crowdsourced-digital-defense-pr/</span></span> program, where bug bounties (payments that would be made upon finding an exploit) were offered to large communities of ethical hackers. This sort of penetration testing allows organizations to have their systems tested by people from a wide range of backgrounds (some people may have illegitimate hacking backgrounds too) to test for vulnerabilities, in return for payment. These sorts of programs give legitimate options to those who are interested in hacking, without having them turn to illegal strategies, whilst giving organizations access to those with the most expertise.

            <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Hacking is a complicated topic, with ethical hackers necessary to help mitigate the risk of large-scale cyberattacks. Ethical hackers not only exist but are utilized by many large legitimate organizations to identify vulnerabilities in their infrastructure. Additionally, social engineering creates many large weaknesses in systems, requiring personnel to be trained properly to avoid an attack.
